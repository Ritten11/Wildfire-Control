We need:

	GUI
	Agents
	Define score (future)
	
Ritten proposes to take Agents with actions including:
	Bulldozer agent
		Moving in cardinal directions
		Cutting in cardinal directions
	Burnability

Travis takes cells with Dirk-Jelle:
	Fire value
	Fuel value
	Ignition value
	Traversability
	Type
	Fire propagation 
	

Ivo take GUI with:
	Add function get_cell(x,y) for GUI and agents
	Cells (updated only)
	Start/stop/pause
	Cell tooltips
	Set parameters
	Reset/Regenerate
	
Generation should be done by Roel(to be discussed):
	Area of bush with cirles of forest, expandable with multiple tiles
	One or multiple fire starts
	(If this is too much for now, create a random-pattern with appropriate ratios)

Coding should be done according to MVC pattern.

Max fire speed = 10mph
